I need to overhaul my website at https://www.artofwoo.org

Your task is to build an incredible homepage for this app. I want it to be creative and unique. Really push the limits of your design capabilities.

You have an empty directory here, I want you to initialize a project with the following specs:

    Vite

    Tailwind

    React

    Typescript

    Bun

Once initialized, I want you to create FIVE different designs. Each design should be creative and unique from all the others that you create. They should be hosted on /1, /2, /3, /4 and /5 respectively.

Don't use any MCPs, skills, or other features in your harness. Show me your organic built-in capabilities for tasteful design.

Use the following port for the dev server: 4000
